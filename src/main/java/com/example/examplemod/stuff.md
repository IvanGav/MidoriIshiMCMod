# Notes

in `models/item/midori_ishi.json`:
- `parent` indicates how it's displayed; `item/generated` is just a 2d texture.
- `textures` indicates where to look for the file of the texture.

in `data/midori_ishi/recipes/...`:
- can use `minecraft:crafting_shaped` with `"pattern": ["###","###","###"]`. Instead of ingredients, use `"key": {"#": {<item info>}, ...}`
